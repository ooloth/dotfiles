# ShellCheck Configuration
# 
# This file configures shellcheck for both local development and CI.
# ShellCheck will automatically find and use this configuration file.

# Disable SC1091: Not following sourced files
# This is expected behavior for our setup - we source utility libraries
# that shellcheck cannot always locate in the correct context
disable=SC1091

# Enable external sources to allow shellcheck to follow sourced files
# when they are available in the project structure
external-sources=true

# Add source paths for our utility libraries
source-path=bin/lib
source-path=test/lib
