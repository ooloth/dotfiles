# ShellCheck Configuration
# 
# This file configures shellcheck for both local development and CI.
# ShellCheck will automatically find and use this configuration file.
#
# IMPORTANT: This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for shellcheck configuration.
# Do NOT add inline shellcheck comments to files (# shellcheck disable=...).
# All shellcheck configuration should be managed here centrally.
# This policy prevents comment proliferation and ensures consistent rules.

# Disable SC1091: Not following sourced files
# This is expected behavior for our setup - we source utility libraries
# that shellcheck cannot always locate in the correct context
#
# Disable SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source
# Our feature discovery system uses dynamic paths which are validated
# before sourcing, so this warning is safe to ignore
#
# Disable SC2154: Variable is referenced but not assigned
# BATS test framework provides variables like $status and $output that
# shellcheck doesn't recognize but are valid in BATS test context
disable=SC1091,SC1090,SC2154

# Enable external sources to allow shellcheck to follow sourced files
# when they are available in the project structure
external-sources=true

# Add source paths for our utility libraries
source-path=bin/lib
source-path=core
source-path=test/lib
source-path=test/install/lib
