# ShellCheck Configuration
# 
# This file configures shellcheck for both local development and CI.
# ShellCheck will automatically find and use this configuration file.
#
# IMPORTANT: This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for shellcheck configuration.
# Do NOT add inline shellcheck comments to files (# shellcheck disable=...).
# All shellcheck configuration should be managed here centrally.
# This policy prevents comment proliferation and ensures consistent rules.

# Disable SC1091: Not following sourced files
# This is expected behavior for our setup - we source utility libraries
# that shellcheck cannot always locate in the correct context
#
# Disable SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source
# Our feature discovery system uses dynamic paths which are validated
# before sourcing, so this warning is safe to ignore
#
# Disable SC2119: Function call suggests parameters but function doesn't use them
# Many functions in our codebase intentionally take no parameters
