# ShellCheck Configuration
#
# Disable SC1091: Not following sourced files
# This is expected behavior for our setup - we source utility libraries
# that shellcheck cannot always locate in the correct context
#
# Disable SC1090: ShellCheck can't follow non-constant source
# Our feature discovery system uses dynamic paths which are validated
# before sourcing, so this warning is safe to ignore
#
# Disable SC2119: Function call suggests parameters but function doesn't use them
# Many functions in our codebase intentionally take no parameters
disable=SC1091,SC1090,SC2059,SC2119
