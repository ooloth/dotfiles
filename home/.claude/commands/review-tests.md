Execute tests and verify comprehensive coverage.

**Test focus (optional):** $ARGUMENTS

**Test Review Process:**

I'll use the test-runner agent to conduct comprehensive test analysis including:

1. **Test execution** with full suite run
2. **Coverage verification** - ensure all test files are running
3. **Test quality** assessment (behavioral vs implementation)
4. **Missing test cases** identification
5. **Test performance** and reliability check
6. **Test documentation** and clarity review

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the test-runner agent for expert test execution and coverage analysis.
