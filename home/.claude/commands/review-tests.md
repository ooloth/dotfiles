description: Test coverage analysis and execution verification

<!-- 
This command provides a systematic approach to test review and coverage verification.
It ensures comprehensive test analysis with quality checks.

## Systematic Test Review Process

1. **Execute all tests** - Run the full test suite and capture results
2. **Analyze coverage** - Check test coverage metrics and identify gaps
3. **Review test quality** - Assess test design, assertions, and edge cases
4. **Identify missing scenarios** - Find untested paths and error conditions
5. **Verify test isolation** - Ensure tests are independent and deterministic
6. **Check performance** - Ensure tests run efficiently

### Quality Criteria:
- Tests cover happy paths and error cases
- Assertions are meaningful and specific
- Test names clearly describe behavior
- No flaky or environment-dependent tests
- Appropriate use of mocks and fixtures
