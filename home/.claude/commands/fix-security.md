Analyze and fix security vulnerabilities in the specified component.

**Security issue:** $ARGUMENTS

**Security Fix Process:**

I'll use the security-auditor agent to systematically address security issues including:

1. **Vulnerability assessment** - identify security weaknesses
2. **Risk evaluation** - understand potential impact
3. **Fix strategy** - choose appropriate security measures
4. **Implementation** - apply security fixes
5. **Verification** - ensure vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Security testing** - validate fixes don't introduce new issues

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the security-auditor agent for expert security analysis and vulnerability remediation.
