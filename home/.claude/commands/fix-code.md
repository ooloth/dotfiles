description: Improve code quality through refactoring and design improvements
---

<!-- 
This command performs comprehensive code improvement with direct expert consultation.
Covers code quality, design patterns, security, and performance optimization.
Consults specialists when beneficial for thorough improvement strategy.

## Systematic Code Improvement Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. **Identify issues** - Code smells, complexity, duplication
2. **Assess impact** - Performance, maintainability, security
3. **Prioritize fixes** - Critical → Important → Nice-to-have

### Phase 2: Refactoring Strategy
1. **Extract methods** - Break down complex functions
2. **Improve naming** - Variables, functions, classes
3. **Reduce coupling** - Better module boundaries
4. **Apply patterns** - Where they add clarity, not complexity
5. **Remove duplication** - DRY principle, extract common code

### Phase 3: Quality Improvements
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive, consistent patterns
- **Type safety** - Add/improve type annotations
- **Documentation** - Add missing docs, clarify complex logic
- **Test coverage** - Add tests for refactored code
- **Performance** - Optimize algorithms, reduce I/O

### Phase 4: Security & Architecture (consult specialists when needed)
- **Security review** → design-architect for vulnerability assessment
- **Performance optimization** → design-architect for architectural impact
- **Design patterns** → design-architect for pattern appropriateness
- **Best practices** → researcher for framework-specific patterns

### Implementation Approach:
1. Make incremental changes with tests
2. Preserve existing behavior (unless fixing bugs)
3. Commit logical units of change
4. Update documentation alongside code
