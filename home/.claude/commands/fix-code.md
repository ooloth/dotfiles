Improve code quality and design for the specified component.

**Code improvement target:** $ARGUMENTS

**Code Improvement Process:**

I'll use the design-architect and code-reviewer agents to systematically improve code including:

1. **Code quality assessment** - identify improvement opportunities
2. **Design analysis** - evaluate current architecture and patterns
3. **Refactoring strategy** - plan improvements
4. **Implementation** - apply code improvements
5. **Quality verification** - ensure changes improve codebase
6. **Testing** - verify refactoring doesn't break functionality

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the design-architect and code-reviewer agents for expert code improvement and refactoring guidance.
