Systematically investigate and fix the specified bug or error.

**Bug description:** $ARGUMENTS

**Bug Fix Process:**

I'll use the debugger, researcher, and data-analyst agents to systematically resolve the issue including:

1. **Error analysis** - parse error messages and stack traces
2. **Research investigation** - look up known issues, documentation, and solutions
3. **Root cause investigation** - systematic debugging approach
4. **Data-specific analysis** - for database, DataFrame, or data processing issues
5. **Issue reproduction** - confirm the problem exists
6. **Solution development** - implement proper fix
7. **Testing** - verify fix works and doesn't break other functionality
8. **Documentation** - explain fix rationale if complex

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the debugger agent for systematic debugging, researcher agent for investigating unknown issues and documentation, and data-analyst agent for data-related problems.
