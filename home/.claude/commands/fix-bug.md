## Systematic Debugging Process

### Phase 0: Planning & Strategy Assessment
**Before diving into debugging, confirm approach:**
- **Have you planned your debugging strategy?** If not, start here:
  1. **Quick assessment** - Is this a simple fix or complex investigation?
  2. **Consider alternatives**:
     - Direct fix (if cause is obvious)
     - Systematic debugging (for complex/mysterious issues)
     - Rollback/revert (if recent change caused it)
     - Ask for help (if completely unfamiliar domain)
  3. **Choose optimal approach** based on complexity and time constraints
  4. **Set time boundaries** - How long to investigate before seeking help?

### Phase 1: Systematic Investigation
1. **Understand expected behavior** - What should happen?
2. **Reproduce consistently** - Minimal steps to trigger issue
3. **Gather information** - Error messages, stack traces, environment
4. **Form hypotheses** - Ranked list of potential causes
5. **Test systematically** - Verify/eliminate hypotheses methodically
6. **Implement solution** - Address root cause, not just symptoms

### Error Analysis Patterns:
- Parse error messages for key information
- Trace stack traces to exact failure points
- Distinguish symptoms from root causes
- Check environmental factors (versions, configs)

### When to consult specialists:
- **researcher**: Unfamiliar frameworks, known issues, documentation
- **design-architect**: Performance issues, architectural problems, data design
