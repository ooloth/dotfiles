## Systematic Debugging Process

1. **Understand expected behavior** - What should happen?
2. **Reproduce consistently** - Minimal steps to trigger issue
3. **Gather information** - Error messages, stack traces, environment
4. **Form hypotheses** - Ranked list of potential causes
5. **Test systematically** - Verify/eliminate hypotheses methodically
6. **Implement solution** - Address root cause, not just symptoms

### Error Analysis Patterns:
- Parse error messages for key information
- Trace stack traces to exact failure points
- Distinguish symptoms from root causes
- Check environmental factors (versions, configs)

### When to consult specialists:
- **researcher**: Unfamiliar frameworks, known issues, documentation
- **design-architect**: Performance issues, architectural problems, data design
