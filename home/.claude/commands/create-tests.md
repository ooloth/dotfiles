Create comprehensive test suite with proper coverage and design.

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

**Test Creation Process:**

I'll use the test-designer, researcher, and data-analyst agents to create comprehensive test coverage including:

1. **Research phase** - investigate testing frameworks and patterns
2. **Test strategy** planning for the target functionality
3. **Data testing** considerations for data processing and validation
4. **Test case design** covering happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
5. **Test implementation** following behavioral testing principles
6. **Test organization** with clear structure and naming
7. **Integration** with existing test suite
8. **Documentation** of test intent and coverage

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the test-designer agent for expert test planning, researcher agent for testing frameworks and patterns, and data-analyst agent for data-related testing strategies.
