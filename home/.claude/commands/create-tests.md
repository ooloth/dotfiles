## Systematic Test Creation Process

1. **Analyze requirements** - Understand what needs testing
2. **Identify test scenarios** - Happy paths, edge cases, error conditions
3. **Design test structure** - Organize tests logically by behavior
4. **Implement tests** - Write clear, focused test cases
5. **Verify coverage** - Ensure all code paths are tested
6. **Add test documentation** - Explain complex test scenarios

### Test Design Principles:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Proper setup and teardown
- Appropriate use of test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes)

### When to consult specialists:
- **researcher**: Testing patterns for specific frameworks
- **design-architect**: Testing architectural components
