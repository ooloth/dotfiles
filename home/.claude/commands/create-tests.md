Create comprehensive test suite with proper coverage and design.

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

**Test Creation Process:**

I'll use the test-designer agent to create comprehensive test coverage including:

1. **Test strategy** planning for the target functionality
2. **Test case design** covering happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Test implementation** following behavioral testing principles
4. **Test organization** with clear structure and naming
5. **Integration** with existing test suite
6. **Documentation** of test intent and coverage

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the test-designer agent for expert test planning and implementation.
