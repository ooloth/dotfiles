Create a draft pull request from the current branch to the main branch.

**Target branch (optional):** $ARGUMENTS

**Process:**
1. Check current branch (must not be main/master)
2. Check working tree for uncommitted changes:
   - Review each change to determine if it belongs with the current PR
   - **Be cautious with temporary changes**: commented-out code, debug prints, config tweaks for testing
   - Ask user before committing anything that looks temporary or experimental
   - For legitimate changes: commit them with the PR
   - For unrelated changes: determine best approach (stash, separate commit, or leave uncommitted)
3. Ensure branch is up to date with latest changes from target branch
4. Ensure branch is pushed to remote
5. Analyze commits since branching from main to understand the changes
6. Read modified files to understand the full scope
7. Check if PR relates to existing project plans or issues and ensure they're updated:
   - Look for related GitHub issues, project roadmaps, or planning documents
   - Check if task tracking files (like `.claude/tasks/*.md`) need updates
   - Verify project documentation reflects the changes being made
8. Generate PR description:
   - **Check for existing PR template** in `.github/pull_request_template.md` or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   - **If project has PR template**: Follow it, but enhance with the spirit of the high-quality template
   - **If no project template**: Use the high-quality template structure (ONLY these sections):
     - üí™ **What**: What's new/different, direct changes to project behavior, testing/documentation status, implementation details
     - ü§î **Why**: Problem solved, business value, timing rationale
     - üëÄ **Usage**: How to use new functionality (if user-facing)
     - üë©‚Äçüî¨ **How to validate**: Manual steps for reviewers to test changes
     - üîó **Related links**: External context with real URLs (only if valuable, omit if none)
   - **Append missing valuable sections** from the high-quality template if not covered by project template
   - **Focus on reviewer experience** - provide context that helps reviewers understand and validate changes
   - **"What" vs "Why" clarity**: "What" describes direct changes/impacts, "Why" explains benefits and rationale
   - **Format requirements**: Start "What" with flat bullet list of primary behavior changes/takeaways, format "Why" as flat bullet list
   - **Avoid file listings**: Don't include "New Files" sections - reviewers will see files in the PR, focus on what the PR accomplishes
   - **Link formatting**: Use markdown links for external URLs, raw URLs for GitHub PRs/issues (GitHub formats them nicely)
   - **Reference related issues/plans** - link to GitHub issues, project plans, or task files this PR addresses
9. Create the draft PR with descriptive title and structured body

**GitHub CLI commands to use:**
- `git branch --show-current` - Get current branch
- `git fetch origin` - Get latest remote changes
- `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` - Check if up to date
- `git log main..HEAD --oneline` - See commits since branching
- `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` - See changed files
- `gh issue list` - Check for related GitHub issues
- Check for `.claude/tasks/*.md`, project roadmaps, or planning documents
- `gh pr create --draft` - Create draft PR

**If target branch is specified as argument, use that instead of main.**

**PR title format:** Use the branch name or first commit message as basis, make it descriptive and clear.
