Plan comprehensive approach for implementing a new feature.

**Feature description:** $ARGUMENTS

**Feature Planning Process:**

I'll use the design-architect and test-designer agents to create comprehensive planning including:

1. **Architecture planning** - design patterns and structure approach
2. **Test strategy** - comprehensive testing approach
3. **Implementation roadmap** - step-by-step development plan
4. **Integration considerations** - how feature fits with existing code
5. **Risk assessment** - potential challenges and mitigation
6. **Definition of done** - clear completion criteria

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the design-architect and test-designer agents for expert feature planning and strategy development.
