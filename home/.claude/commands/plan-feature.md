Plan comprehensive approach for implementing a new feature.

**Feature description:** $ARGUMENTS

**Feature Planning Process:**

I'll use the design-architect, test-designer, researcher, and data-analyst agents to create comprehensive planning including:

1. **Research phase** - investigate relevant documentation, APIs, and best practices
2. **Architecture planning** - design patterns and structure approach  
3. **Data considerations** - data processing, storage, and performance requirements
4. **Test strategy** - comprehensive testing approach
5. **Implementation roadmap** - step-by-step development plan
6. **Integration considerations** - how feature fits with existing code
7. **Risk assessment** - potential challenges and mitigation
8. **Definition of done** - clear completion criteria

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the design-architect, test-designer, researcher (for documentation and best practices), and data-analyst (for data-related features) agents for expert feature planning and strategy development.
