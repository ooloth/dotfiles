Conduct full quality assessment covering all quality dimensions.

**Target (optional):** $ARGUMENTS

**Quality Review Process:**

I'll use multiple expert agents for comprehensive quality analysis:

1. **Code quality** - code-reviewer agent for bugs, readability, maintainability
2. **Security audit** - security-auditor agent for vulnerabilities and secure practices  
3. **Performance analysis** - performance-optimizer agent for bottlenecks and optimizations
4. **Data quality** - data-analyst agent for data processing, queries, and pipeline efficiency
5. **Research validation** - researcher agent to verify best practices and current standards
6. **Test coverage** - test-runner agent for comprehensive test verification

**Multi-Agent Delegation:**
This command coordinates multiple specialist agents including the new researcher and data-analyst agents to provide complete quality assessment across all dimensions.

**Output:**
- Combined quality score and priority recommendations
- Integrated improvement plan across all quality aspects
- Prioritized action items by impact and effort
