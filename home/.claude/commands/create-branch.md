Create a new Git branch with proper naming conventions and setup.

**Branch purpose:** $ARGUMENTS

**Branch Creation Process:**

I'll use the git-workflow agent to create a properly named and configured branch including:

1. **Branch naming** - following project conventions (feature/, fix/, etc.)
2. **Branch creation** - from appropriate base branch (usually main)
3. **Initial setup** - ensure clean working directory
4. **Branch tracking** - set up remote tracking if needed
5. **Workflow guidance** - next steps for development on the branch

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the git-workflow agent for expert Git branch management and workflow guidance.
