Analyze and fix performance issues in the specified component.

**Performance issue:** $ARGUMENTS

**Performance Fix Process:**

I'll use the performance-optimizer, data-analyst, and researcher agents to systematically improve performance including:

1. **Performance profiling** - identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Research investigation** - look up optimization techniques and tools
3. **Data analysis** - analyze database queries and data processing performance
4. **Bottleneck analysis** - understand root causes
5. **Optimization strategy** - choose appropriate improvements
6. **Implementation** - apply performance fixes
7. **Measurement** - verify performance improvements
8. **Trade-off evaluation** - ensure fixes don't compromise other aspects

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the performance-optimizer agent for expert performance analysis, data-analyst agent for data-related performance issues, and researcher agent for optimization techniques and tools.
