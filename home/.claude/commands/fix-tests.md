Resolve test failures and improve test coverage for specified component.

**Test issue:** $ARGUMENTS

**Test Fix Process:**

I'll use the test-runner and test-designer agents to systematically address test issues including:

1. **Test failure analysis** - understand why tests are failing
2. **Root cause identification** - determine if issue is in code or tests
3. **Fix implementation** - resolve the underlying issue
4. **Coverage improvement** - add missing test cases
5. **Test verification** - ensure all tests pass
6. **Quality assessment** - review test effectiveness

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the test-runner and test-designer agents for expert test debugging and improvement.
