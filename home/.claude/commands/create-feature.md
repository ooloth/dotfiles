Implement new feature with comprehensive development workflow.

**Feature description:** $ARGUMENTS

**Feature Implementation Process:**

I'll use the software-engineer agent to implement the feature including:

1. **Feature analysis** - understand requirements and scope
2. **Design consideration** - coordinate with design-architect agent if needed
3. **Implementation** - write feature code following project patterns
4. **Testing integration** - work with test-designer agent for test coverage
5. **Code review** - coordinate with code-reviewer agent for quality checks
6. **Documentation** - update relevant documentation
7. **Integration** - ensure feature works with existing codebase

**Agent Delegation:**
This command automatically uses the software-engineer agent for expert feature implementation, coordinating with other specialist agents as needed.
