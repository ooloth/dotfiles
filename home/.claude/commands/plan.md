<!--
This command performs intelligent problem analysis and solution planning.
Analyzes the problem systematically and coordinates with relevant experts when beneficial.
Provides structured solution recommendations with clear next steps.

## Systematic Problem Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Domain Identification

1. **Clarify the challenge** - What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Identify constraints** - Timeline, resources, technical limitations
3. **Determine domain(s)** - Technical, documentation, data, process, strategic
4. **Define success criteria** - Measurable outcomes

### Phase 2: Expert Coordination (when beneficial)

- **Technical problems:** researcher
- **Data problems:** researcher (for data architecture)
- **Process problems:** researcher
- **Complex problems:** Coordinate multiple specialists in parallel

### Phase 3: Solution Development

1. **Generate 2-4 viable alternatives**
2. **Analyze trade-offs** (complexity, timeline, resources, risk, scalability)
3. **Consider implementation sequence** and dependencies

### Phase 4: Structured Recommendation

- Problem summary and key considerations
- Alternative approaches with pros/cons
- Recommended approach with rationale
- Implementation plan and next steps

Challenge: $ARGUMENTS
