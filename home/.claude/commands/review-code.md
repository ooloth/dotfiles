## Systematic Code Review Process

1. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Readability and clarity
   - Proper naming conventions
   - Code organization and structure
   - DRY principles and appropriate abstractions

2. **Bug and Error Detection**
   - Logic errors and edge cases
   - Error handling completeness
   - Resource management (memory, connections)
   - Race conditions and concurrency issues

3. **Security Review** (consult design-architect for complex cases)
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication/authorization checks
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Common vulnerability patterns

4. **Performance Analysis** (consult design-architect for architecture impact)
   - Algorithm efficiency
   - Database query optimization
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Caching opportunities

5. **Test Coverage Assessment**
   - Missing test scenarios
   - Test quality and assertions
   - Edge case coverage
   - Test maintainability

6. **Documentation and Maintainability**
   - Code comments for complex logic
   - API documentation completeness
   - README updates needed

### When to consult specialists:
- **design-architect**: Complex security issues, architectural concerns, performance bottlenecks
- **researcher**: Unfamiliar frameworks, best practice verification
