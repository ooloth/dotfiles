# Create New Skill

I'll help you create a new skill following the guidance in `tools/claude/config/skills/@template/README.md`.

## What should this skill do?

Describe the task or workflow this skill will handle.

---

Once you tell me, I'll:

1. **Read the template guidance**: `tools/claude/config/skills/@template/README.md`
2. **Confirm it's appropriate for a skill** (vs agent/command)
3. **Suggest a name** following the gerund + noun convention
4. **Create the skill structure** based on the template
5. **Implement following all best practices** documented in the template
6. **Test and validate**

**What should this skill do?**
