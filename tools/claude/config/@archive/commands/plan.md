## Systematic Problem Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Domain Identification

1. **Clarify the challenge** - What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Identify constraints** - Timeline, resources, technical limitations
3. **Determine domain(s)** - Technical, documentation, data, process, strategic
4. **Define success criteria** - Measurable outcomes

### Phase 2: Expert Coordination (when beneficial)

...

### Phase 3: Solution Development

1. **Generate 2-4 viable alternatives** - use parallel sub-agents if helpful
2. **Analyze trade-offs** (complexity, timeline, resources, risk, scalability)
3. **Consider implementation sequence** and dependencies

### Phase 4: Structured Recommendation

- Problem summary and key considerations
- Alternative approaches with pros/cons
- Recommended approach with rationale
- Implementation plan and next steps

Challenge: $ARGUMENTS
