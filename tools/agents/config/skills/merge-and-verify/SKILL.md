description: Watch a merged pull request's rollout until it is serving, then prove its effect with prove-it-works, given one sentence naming the PR. TRIGGER when a PR has just merged and its deploy needs watching, or when asked to verify a merged PR in its environment.
argument-hint: 'A merged PR, such as "react-clinops-siteoutreach#299"'

Input: $ARGUMENTS

Merging is not part of this skill yet. If the PR has not merged, say so and stop; the user merges
it, then calls this again.

## What to work out first

One sentence naming the PR is enough. Get the rest from the environment, and ask the user only for
what none of it holds, such as a credential only they can refresh.

- **The merge commit,** from the PR.
- **The ticket,** from a Jira key in the PR's branch, title or body, or an issue it closes. A PR
  with neither has no ticket; say so.
- **The claim to prove:** the ticket's properties, plus each side effect the PR's review named.
  Trace each part to the property or comment it came from.
- **The deploy chain,** from the docs of the repo and of every repo the deploy passes through, such
  as a GitOps repo: each stage between the merge and the running service, and how to read what is
  serving at the end. If the docs don't say how to read what is serving, stop and say what is
  missing. If the merge changed nothing that deploys, say so and why, skip the watch, and go
  straight to the proof.

## Watching the rollout

**Serving** means the live artifact (a revision, an image digest, the tag that digest carries) was
built from the merge commit or from a later trunk commit that contains it, as GitHub's compare of
the two says. A run's status, a pipeline's "success" or a health badge never counts. Name the
artifact you read.

Each check reads the whole chain from scratch, so a check after a restart, a closed session or a
missed check needs nothing remembered. Save each command's raw output in the evidence folder
`prove-it-works` uses for the merge commit, `~/Repos/agents/prove-it-works/<owner>-<repo>/<merge
commit>/`, in a new subfolder for this watch. Then report what changed since the last check, as a
finished message.

Between checks, schedule the next one about 5 minutes out with a one-shot `CronCreate` whose prompt
says to continue this watch, and end the turn, so each report reaches the user and the session is
free in between. Where `CronCreate` doesn't exist, sleep between checks instead and say that
reports will arrive together.

The watch ends in exactly one of these, and the report names which:

- **Serving,** with the artifact and the compare that shows it contains the merge.
- **A stage failed,** naming the stage and quoting its output.
- **A new revision failed to start while an older one still serves,** quoting its condition.
- **Waiting on a person,** saying who and for what, such as an approval step or a manual migration.
- **Credentials expired,** with the command the user runs to refresh them.
- **Nothing deploys.**
- **Pinned or rolled back:** what is serving does not contain the merge and is not an older commit
  still waiting to be replaced.
- **The deadline passed:** 60 minutes after the PR's `mergedAt` with no other ending.
- **Repeated errors** reading a stage, after a retry and the obvious alternatives.

A check that can't read a stage never reports "still rolling out". The deadline ends only a watch
that is still waiting: a watch started after it still checks once, and reports whatever that check
finds.

Read remote state through `gh` and each provider's own CLI or API. Don't `git fetch` or otherwise
change a local clone to read it.

## The proof

Once the change is serving, or nothing deploys, run `prove-it-works` with the claim, using the same
evidence folder. Show the user a draft report: the PR, merge commit and ticket, the claim and where
each part came from, the rollout from merge to its ending, and the `prove-it-works` report
unchanged. Post nothing, and change nothing in any deployed environment.
