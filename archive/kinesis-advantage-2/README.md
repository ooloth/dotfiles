## Prerequisites

1. Connect the keyboard to your computer
2. If necessary, the keyboard's firmware to the latest version by following [these instructions](https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage2/#firmware-updates)
3. Leave your keyboard in the default QWERTY mode

## Tip

For safety, manually record all your remaps, macros and settings in version-controlled backup copies of `qwerty.txt` and `state.txt` and don't use the SmartSet app or onboard programming functions.

## Update your backup copies of qwerty.txt and state.txt

- Use `state.txt` to record your settings
- Use `qwerty.txt` to record your remaps and macros
- The remaps and macros are written with the original QWERTY input key on left + the new output key(s) on the right
- Use `[]` for remaps
- `{}` for macros
- Use `[t&h120]` to create tap-and-hold remap variants (adjust `120` to your preferred delay in `ms`)
- Use `[hyper]` to remap to a combo of shift+ctrl+alt+cmd
- Use `[meh]` to remap to a combo of ctrl+alt+cmd

## Apply changes to keyboard

1. Place the keyboard in power-user mode by pressing progm+shift+esc
2. Mount the keyboard's v-Drive by pressing progm+F1
3. Open the mounted drive in a file explorer app (e.g. Finder)
4. Navigate to the `/active` folder
5. Replace `qwerty.txt` and `state.txt` with your new versions
6. Press progm+F1 again to unmount the v-Drive and apply the new configuration
