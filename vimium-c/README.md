# Vimium-C

It's [not possible](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c/issues/563) to sync Vimium-C's settings to a file, so as a workaround, here's a best-effort attempt to document the settings I've customized.

I use Vimium-C as a Chrome-only solution on my work laptop, which blocks Surfingkeys' file-based configuration approach. On my personal laptop, SurfingKeys is still my preferred solution since it works across browsers.

## üñêÔ∏è Custom key mappings
