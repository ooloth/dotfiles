# Bash Migration Epic

## Current Status (July 12, 2025)

**Task**: Migrate dotfiles installation infrastructure from custom zsh to industry-standard bash + shellcheck + bats
**Approach**: Parallel development - building complete bash setup system alongside existing zsh system
**Current**: Phase 1 nearly complete - setup.bash + 8 installation scripts + all core utilities migrated

### Parallel System Status

**Bash setup system** (`setup.bash`):
- âœ… Core utilities: machine-detection, prerequisite-validation, dry-run, error-handling
- âœ… Installation scripts: ssh, github, homebrew, rust, node, neovim, tmux, symlinks  
- âœ… Test coverage: 57+ comprehensive tests across all components
- âœ… Quality: Zero shellcheck warnings across all bash files
- âœ… Integration: setup.bash orchestrates all available bash scripts

**Zsh setup system** (`setup.zsh`):
- âœ… Fully functional and unchanged
- âœ… Still the primary/production setup method
- âœ… Uses some shared bash utilities (machine-detection, etc.)
- âœ… Independent operation - no dependency on bash migration progress

## Migration Strategy

**CRITICAL: Parallel Development Approach**

This migration uses a **parallel development strategy** - we are building a complete bash-based setup flow alongside the existing zsh setup, NOT replacing it incrementally:

- **Existing system**: `setup.zsh` + `bin/install/*.zsh` (continues to work, unchanged)
- **New parallel system**: `setup.bash` + `bin/install/*.bash` (being built independently)
- **Shared utilities**: `bin/lib/*.bash` (used by both systems during transition)

**Why parallel?**
- Zero disruption to existing workflows during development
- Complete system validation before any replacement
- Easy rollback if issues discovered
- Allows thorough testing of new approach

**Integration points**:
- `setup.bash` sources bash installation scripts as they become available
- Missing bash scripts fall back to zsh versions during transition
- Both systems can coexist indefinitely until cutover decision

### Phase 1: Setup + Core Infrastructure Migration (IN PROGRESS - Enhanced Scope)
**Goal**: Build complete bash setup system + core installation scripts + shared utilities for maximum tooling leverage

### Phase 2: Remaining Script Migration (Pending)
**Goal**: Migrate remaining installation scripts using established three-tier architecture

**Enhanced Priority Order**:
1. `setup.bash` - Main entry point with shared utility integration
2. `bin/lib/*.bash` - All utility libraries (machine-detection, prerequisite-validation, etc.)
3. `bin/install/homebrew.bash` - Final core script with shared utility extraction
4. Remaining scripts based on dependency analysis

**Three-Tier Architecture Pattern**:
1. **Core utilities (bash)**: `lib/*-utils.bash` - Pure logic, shellcheck compliant, fully tested
2. **Setup orchestration (bash)**: `setup.bash` - Calls utilities directly, professional tooling
3. **Interactive tools (zsh)**: `bin/update/*.zsh` - Thin wrappers, rich user experience

### Phase 3: Framework Cleanup and CI Enhancement (Pending)
**Goal**: Remove zsh test framework, update CI, and add shellcheck validation

**Tasks**:
- Update `.github/workflows/test-dotfiles.yml` to use bats instead of custom runner
- Add shellcheck step to CI pipeline for all bash scripts
- Configure shellcheck with appropriate exclusions (e.g., SC1091 for sourced files)
- Remove `test/run-tests.zsh` and custom zsh test utilities
- Update documentation to reflect bash-first approach
- Archive zsh test framework with migration notes

## Key Decisions Made

### Enhanced Architecture: Bash Infrastructure + Zsh User Experience
- **setup.bash**: Main entry point for maximum tooling leverage (shellcheck + bats)
- **lib/*-utils.bash**: Shared logic for code reuse between setup and updates
- **bin/update/*.zsh**: Interactive tools stay zsh for rich user shell experience
- **Reasoning**: Best of both worlds - professional development tools + user-friendly shell

### Bash + Shellcheck + Bats Stack for Infrastructure
- **Bash**: Universal, better CI support, consistent behavior, fresh machine friendly
- **Shellcheck**: Industry-standard linting, catches common errors, enforces best practices
- **Bats**: Mature testing framework, wide adoption, good GitHub Actions support

### Migration Approach: Setup.bash as Forcing Function
- **Rejected**: Incremental script-by-script migration without setup changes
- **Chosen**: setup.bash + core scripts + shared utilities as complete system
- **Reasoning**: Forces architectural consistency, enables code sharing, validates entire approach

### Test Coverage Standards
- **Utilities**: Comprehensive unit tests for all functions
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing with mocking
- **Compliance**: All bash scripts must pass shellcheck with zero warnings
- **Behavioral Focus**: Test what code does, not implementation details

## Technical Patterns Established

### File Structure Pattern
```
lib/{component}-utils.bash          # Utility functions
bin/install/{component}.bash        # Installation script  
test/install/test-{component}-utils.bats     # Unit tests
test/install/test-{component}-installation.bats  # Integration tests
```

### Shellcheck CI Configuration (Planned)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
- name: Run ShellCheck
  uses: ludeeus/action-shellcheck@master
  with:
    scandir: '.'
    check_together: 'yes'
    ignore_paths: 'test/install/lib'  # Mock scripts
    severity: 'error'
    format: 'gcc'
```

**Shellcheck Standards**:
- All bash scripts must pass with zero warnings
- Use inline directives sparingly (prefer fixing the issue)
- Document any necessary exclusions (e.g., SC1091 for sourced files)
- Configure `.shellcheckrc` for project-wide settings if needed

### Bash Script Standards
- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- `set -euo pipefail` strict mode
- Shellcheck compliance (zero warnings)
- Function documentation with usage examples
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Test Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage (both success and failure paths)
- Environment isolation with setup/teardown
- Mocking of external dependencies
- Clear test descriptions and assertions
- Integration tests that verify complete workflows

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions currently uses custom zsh test runner
- **Future**: Migrate to bats with better reporting and parallelization
- **Future**: Add shellcheck validation step for all bash scripts
- **Benefits**: 
  - Standard test output format, better integration with GitHub UI
  - Automated code quality enforcement via shellcheck
  - Catch shell scripting issues before merge

### Code Sharing Strategy
- **Extract to utilities**: Shared logic between setup and update scripts goes to `lib/*-utils.bash`
- **Three-tier reuse**: Core utilities (bash) + Setup orchestration (bash) + Interactive wrappers (zsh)
- **Maximum leverage**: Shellcheck + bats testing for all shared business logic
- **Example**: `lib/homebrew-utils.bash` used by both `setup.bash` and `bin/update/homebrew.zsh`

### Parallel System Boundaries

**Bash setup system** (new, being built):
- `setup.bash` - Main entry point with comprehensive error handling and validation
- `bin/install/*.bash` - Installation scripts with shellcheck compliance and bats testing
- `bin/lib/*.bash` - Shared utilities used by both setup systems
- **Benefits**: Professional tooling (shellcheck + bats), better error handling, consistent behavior

**Zsh setup system** (existing, unchanged):
- `setup.zsh` - Original entry point, continues to work
- `bin/install/*.zsh` - Original installation scripts, still functional
- `config/zsh/*`, `bin/update/*.zsh` - Interactive user experience (unchanged)
- **Benefits**: Rich shell features, established workflows, user familiarity

**Shared components** (used by both):
- `bin/lib/*.bash` - Core utilities (machine detection, prerequisites, etc.)
- Configuration files and symlink targets (unchanged)

## Discovered Issues

### Critical Setup.zsh Bug (FIXED)
**Issue**: `setup.zsh` references `$DOTFILES` files via `source` commands before the dotfiles repository is cloned
**Impact**: Setup process fails on fresh installations
**Priority**: High - affects core functionality  
**Status**: PR #14 MERGED - fixed dependency ordering issue
**Solution**: Basic git check before clone, comprehensive utilities after clone (line 128+)

### Dead Code Prevention
**Pattern**: Every function/utility must have demonstrated usage in the same PR
**Enforcement**: CLAUDE.md updated with strict guidelines
**Benefit**: Prevents speculative code that becomes maintenance burden

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Current)
- âœ… 20 comprehensive tests passing
- âœ… Zero shellcheck warnings
- âœ… Feature parity with original zsh scripts
- âœ… Complete behavior bundle (utilities + tests + integration + usage)
- ðŸ”„ User review and approval

### Phase 2 (Future)
- All installation scripts migrated to bash
- Comprehensive bats test coverage
- CI pipeline updated to use bats
- Documentation updated

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Custom zsh test framework removed
- Clean codebase with single testing approach
- Improved developer experience with standard tooling
