# Bash Migration Epic

## Current Status (July 26, 2025 - Architecture Revision)

**Task**: Migrate dotfiles installation infrastructure from custom zsh to industry-standard bash + shellcheck + bats
**Approach**: Parallel development - building complete bash setup system alongside existing zsh system
**Current**: Phase 1 & 2 complete - setup.bash + all remaining installation scripts + comprehensive utility libraries migrated
**Achievement**: 8 draft PRs created with 148+ new tests, ready for review and merge
**New Direction**: Adopting feature-based folder architecture for better organization and discoverability

### Parallel System Status

**Bash setup system** (`setup.bash`):
- ✅ Core utilities: machine-detection, prerequisite-validation, dry-run, error-handling
- ✅ Installation scripts: ssh, github, homebrew, zsh, rust, uv, node, neovim, tmux, yazi, content, settings, symlinks  
- ✅ Shared utility libraries: npm-utils, macos-utils, mode-utils, plus enhanced error handling
- ✅ Test coverage: 200+ comprehensive tests across all components
- ✅ Quality: Zero shellcheck warnings across all bash files
- ✅ Integration: setup.bash orchestrates all available bash scripts
- ✅ Complete coverage: All installation scripts migrated to bash

**Zsh setup system** (`setup.zsh`):
- ✅ Fully functional and unchanged
- ✅ Still the primary/production setup method
- ✅ Uses some shared bash utilities (machine-detection, etc.)
- ✅ Independent operation - no dependency on bash migration progress

## Migration Strategy

**CRITICAL: Parallel Development Approach**

This migration uses a **parallel development strategy** - we are building a complete bash-based setup flow alongside the existing zsh setup, NOT replacing it incrementally:

- **Existing system**: `setup.zsh` + `bin/install/*.zsh` (continues to work, unchanged)
- **New parallel system**: `setup.bash` + `bin/install/*.bash` (being built independently)
- **Shared utilities**: `bin/lib/*.bash` (used by both systems during transition)

**Why parallel?**
- Zero disruption to existing workflows during development
- Complete system validation before any replacement
- Easy rollback if issues discovered
- Allows thorough testing of new approach

**Integration points**:
- `setup.bash` sources bash installation scripts as they become available
- Missing bash scripts fall back to zsh versions during transition
- Both systems can coexist indefinitely until cutover decision

### Phase 2 Accomplishments Summary

**Installation Scripts Migrated**: 4 scripts (zsh, yazi, content, settings)
**Utility Libraries Extracted**: 4 libraries (npm, macos, mode, plus enhanced error handling)
**Total New PRs**: 8 draft PRs ready for review
**Test Coverage**: 148+ new utility function tests
**Quality Standards**: Zero shellcheck warnings across all bash scripts
**Architecture**: Three-tier pattern fully established and demonstrated

**Enhanced Priority Order**:
1. `setup.bash` - Main entry point with shared utility integration
2. `bin/lib/*.bash` - All utility libraries (machine-detection, prerequisite-validation, etc.)
3. `bin/install/homebrew.bash` - Final core script with shared utility extraction
4. Remaining scripts based on dependency analysis

**Three-Tier Architecture Pattern**:
1. **Core utilities (bash)**: `lib/*-utils.bash` - Pure logic, shellcheck compliant, fully tested
2. **Setup orchestration (bash)**: `setup.bash` - Calls utilities directly, professional tooling
3. **Interactive tools (zsh)**: `bin/update/*.zsh` - Thin wrappers, rich user experience

### Phase 3: Feature-Based Architecture Migration (NEW - July 26, 2025)
**Goal**: Reorganize bash infrastructure into feature-based folders for better discoverability and maintainability

**Architecture Vision**:
```
dotfiles/
├── setup.bash              # Main entry point
├── setup.zsh               # Legacy entry point (during transition)
├── core/                   # Cross-cutting infrastructure
│   ├── detection/          # Machine/environment detection
│   ├── prerequisites/      # System validation  
│   ├── dry-run/           # Safe execution mode
│   └── errors/            # Error handling
├── features/              # One folder per tool (flat structure)
│   ├── homebrew/
│   │   ├── install.bash
│   │   ├── update.bash
│   │   ├── utils.bash
│   │   ├── config/        # Brewfile, etc.
│   │   └── tests/
│   ├── ssh/
│   │   ├── install.bash
│   │   ├── update.bash  
│   │   ├── utils.bash
│   │   ├── config/        # SSH configs
│   │   └── tests/
│   ├── git/
│   ├── github/
│   ├── neovim/
│   ├── tmux/
│   ├── node/
│   ├── rust/
│   ├── uv/
│   ├── zsh/
│   ├── starship/
│   ├── kitty/
│   ├── yazi/
│   └── [etc...]           # Each tool gets its own folder
├── platform/              # Platform-specific
│   └── macos/
│       ├── defaults.bash
│       ├── settings.bash
│       └── Brewfile
└── legacy/                # Current structure during migration
    ├── bin/
    ├── lib/
    └── config/
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **Screaming Architecture**: Immediately obvious what tools are available
- **Feature Cohesion**: All files for a feature together (install, update, config, tests)
- **Flat Structure**: No category nesting - each feature directly under /features
- **Migration Path**: Can eventually move features/ contents to root level
- **Separation**: Clear boundary between new bash system and existing zsh files

**Migration Tasks**:
1. Create /features directory structure
2. Move bash files to feature folders as proof of concept (start with SSH)
3. Update setup.bash to discover and use feature folders
4. Create symlinks from old locations during transition
5. Move configs to their feature folders
6. Update tests to live with their features
7. Document standard feature structure

**Standard Feature Structure**:
```
features/{tool}/
├── install.bash      # Installation logic
├── update.bash       # Update logic (if applicable)
├── utils.bash        # Shared utilities
├── config/           # Tool-specific configs to symlink
├── tests/            # Feature-specific tests
└── README.md         # Feature documentation (optional)
```

### Phase 4: Framework Cleanup and CI Enhancement (Previously Phase 3)
**Goal**: Remove zsh test framework, update CI, and add shellcheck validation

**Tasks**:
- Update `.github/workflows/test-dotfiles.yml` to use bats instead of custom runner
- Add shellcheck step to CI pipeline for all bash scripts
- Configure shellcheck with appropriate exclusions (e.g., SC1091 for sourced files)
- Remove `test/run-tests.zsh` and custom zsh test utilities
- Update documentation to reflect bash-first approach
- Archive zsh test framework with migration notes

## Key Decisions Made

### Enhanced Architecture: Bash Infrastructure + Zsh User Experience
- **setup.bash**: Main entry point for maximum tooling leverage (shellcheck + bats)
- **lib/*-utils.bash**: Shared logic for code reuse between setup and updates
- **bin/update/*.zsh**: Interactive tools stay zsh for rich user shell experience
- **Reasoning**: Best of both worlds - professional development tools + user-friendly shell

### Bash + Shellcheck + Bats Stack for Infrastructure
- **Bash**: Universal, better CI support, consistent behavior, fresh machine friendly
- **Shellcheck**: Industry-standard linting, catches common errors, enforces best practices
- **Bats**: Mature testing framework, wide adoption, good GitHub Actions support

### Migration Approach: Setup.bash as Forcing Function
- **Rejected**: Incremental script-by-script migration without setup changes
- **Chosen**: setup.bash + core scripts + shared utilities as complete system
- **Reasoning**: Forces architectural consistency, enables code sharing, validates entire approach

### Test Coverage Standards
- **Utilities**: Comprehensive unit tests for all functions
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow testing with mocking
- **Compliance**: All bash scripts must pass shellcheck with zero warnings
- **Behavioral Focus**: Test what code does, not implementation details

## Technical Patterns Established

### File Structure Pattern
```
lib/{component}-utils.bash          # Utility functions
bin/install/{component}.bash        # Installation script  
test/install/test-{component}-utils.bats     # Unit tests
test/install/test-{component}-installation.bats  # Integration tests
```

### Shellcheck CI Configuration (Planned)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/shellcheck.yml
- name: Run ShellCheck
  uses: ludeeus/action-shellcheck@master
  with:
    scandir: '.'
    check_together: 'yes'
    ignore_paths: 'test/install/lib'  # Mock scripts
    severity: 'error'
    format: 'gcc'
```

**Shellcheck Standards**:
- All bash scripts must pass with zero warnings
- Use inline directives sparingly (prefer fixing the issue)
- Document any necessary exclusions (e.g., SC1091 for sourced files)
- Configure `.shellcheckrc` for project-wide settings if needed

### Bash Script Standards
- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- `set -euo pipefail` strict mode
- Shellcheck compliance (zero warnings)
- Function documentation with usage examples
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Test Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage (both success and failure paths)
- Environment isolation with setup/teardown
- Mocking of external dependencies
- Clear test descriptions and assertions
- Integration tests that verify complete workflows

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions currently uses custom zsh test runner
- **Future**: Migrate to bats with better reporting and parallelization
- **Future**: Add shellcheck validation step for all bash scripts
- **Benefits**: 
  - Standard test output format, better integration with GitHub UI
  - Automated code quality enforcement via shellcheck
  - Catch shell scripting issues before merge

### Code Sharing Strategy
- **Extract to utilities**: Shared logic between setup and update scripts goes to `lib/*-utils.bash`
- **Three-tier reuse**: Core utilities (bash) + Setup orchestration (bash) + Interactive wrappers (zsh)
- **Maximum leverage**: Shellcheck + bats testing for all shared business logic
- **Example**: `lib/homebrew-utils.bash` used by both `setup.bash` and `bin/update/homebrew.zsh`

### Parallel System Boundaries

**Bash setup system** (new, being built):
- `setup.bash` - Main entry point with comprehensive error handling and validation
- `bin/install/*.bash` - Installation scripts with shellcheck compliance and bats testing
- `bin/lib/*.bash` - Shared utilities used by both setup systems
- **Benefits**: Professional tooling (shellcheck + bats), better error handling, consistent behavior

**Zsh setup system** (existing, unchanged):
- `setup.zsh` - Original entry point, continues to work
- `bin/install/*.zsh` - Original installation scripts, still functional
- `config/zsh/*`, `bin/update/*.zsh` - Interactive user experience (unchanged)
- **Benefits**: Rich shell features, established workflows, user familiarity

**Shared components** (used by both):
- `bin/lib/*.bash` - Core utilities (machine detection, prerequisites, etc.)
- Configuration files and symlink targets (unchanged)

## Discovered Issues

### Critical Setup.zsh Bug (FIXED)
**Issue**: `setup.zsh` references `$DOTFILES` files via `source` commands before the dotfiles repository is cloned
**Impact**: Setup process fails on fresh installations
**Priority**: High - affects core functionality  
**Status**: PR #14 MERGED - fixed dependency ordering issue
**Solution**: Basic git check before clone, comprehensive utilities after clone (line 128+)

### Dead Code Prevention
**Pattern**: Every function/utility must have demonstrated usage in the same PR
**Enforcement**: CLAUDE.md updated with strict guidelines
**Benefit**: Prevents speculative code that becomes maintenance burden

## Success Metrics

   - Update symlink creation logic
   - Test all symlinks still work

6. **Cleanup and optimize**:
   - Remove empty legacy directories
   - Update all documentation
   - Consider moving features/ to root

## Enhanced Development Workflow

**Setup.bash-centered approach**:
1. **Extract shared logic** to utilities during each script migration
2. **Validate with setup.bash** to ensure utilities work in real setup context
3. **Update interactive tools** to use shared utilities (preserving user experience)
4. **Test comprehensively** with bats for all bash infrastructure
5. **Maintain compatibility** with existing user shell workflows

## Architecture Benefits Summary

### Why Feature-Based Architecture?

**Current Pain Points**:
- Files scattered across `bin/install/`, `lib/`, `config/`, `test/install/`
- Hard to see what tools are available at a glance
- Difficult to understand dependencies between components
- Tests separated from the code they test

**Feature Architecture Benefits**:
- **Discoverability**: `ls features/` shows all available tools
- **Cohesion**: Everything for SSH in `features/ssh/`
- **Independence**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Testability**: Tests live with the code they test
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove features
- **Migration-Friendly**: Clear separation of bash (features/) from zsh (legacy/)

**Future Vision**:
- Eventually move contents of `features/` to root level
- Each tool becomes a top-level directory
- Maximum clarity and simplicity
- Similar to how many modern CLIs organize (e.g., kubectl plugins)
