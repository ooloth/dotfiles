# Where are my neovim configs?

All nvim configs are in "nvim-\*" folders so I can easily switch between them.

To invoke a particular config, use the following command:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-[config] nvim
```

For example, to invoke the "nvim-ide" config, use the following command:

```sh
NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-ide nvim
```
